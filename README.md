Sentry SDK for Clojure
===========

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/io.sentry/sentry-clj.svg)](https://clojars.org/io.sentry/sentry-clj)

A very thin wrapper around the [official Java library for
Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/).

This project follows the version scheme MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS where MAJOR and
MINOR provide some relative indication of the size of the change, but do not
follow semantic versioning. In general, all changes endeavour to be
non-breaking (by moving to new names rather than by breaking existing names).
COMMITS is an ever-increasing counter of commits since the beginning of this
repository.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[sentry-clj.core :as sentry])

; You can initialize Sentry manually by providing a DSN or use one of the
; other optional configuration options supplied as a map (see below).

(sentry/init! "https://public:private@sentry.io/1")

; Sending a simple message is easy...

(try
  (do-something-risky)
  (catch Exception e
    (sentry/send-event {:message "Something has gone wrong!"
                        :throwable e})))
```

If you want an interpolated message, you need to provide the full map, i.e.,

```
(try
  (do-something-risky)
  (catch Exception e
    (sentry/send-event {:message {:message "Something %s has gone %s!"
                                  :params ["foo" "bar"]}
                        :throwable e})))
```

Some examples:

Basic Initialisation (using defaults):

```clojure
(sentry/init! "https://public:private@sentry.io/1")
```

Initialisation with additional options:

```clojure
(sentry/init! "https://public:private@sentry.io/1" {:environment "staging" :debug true :release "foo.bar@1.0.0" :in-app-excludes ["foo.bar"])
```

```clojure
(sentry/init! "https://public:private@sentry.io/1" {:before-send-fn (fn [event _] (when-not (= (.. event getMessage getMessage "foo")) event))})
```

```clojure
(sentry/init! "https://public:private@sentry.io/1" {:before-send-fn (fn [event _] (.setServerName event "fred") event)})
```

```clojure
(sentry/init! "https://public:private@sentry.io/1" {:contexts {:foo "bar" :baz "wibble"}})
```

## Supported event keys

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/)

- `:breadcrumbs` - a collection of `Breadcrumb` maps. See below.
- `:dist` - a `String` which identifies the distribution.
- `:environment` - a `String` which identifies the environment.
- `:event-id` - a `String` id to use for the event. If not provided, one will be automatically generated.
- `:extra` - a map with `Keyword` or `String` keys (or anything for which `clojure.core/name` can be invoked) and values which can be JSON-ified. If `:throwable` is given, this will automatically include its `ex-data`.
  - **note**: `:extra` has been deprecated in favour of `:contexts` upon initialisation
- `:fingerprints` - a sequence of `String`s that Sentry should use as a [fingerprint](https://docs.sentry.io/learn/rollups/#customize-grouping-with-fingerprints).
- `:level` - a `Keyword`. One of `:debug`, `:info`, `:warning`, `:error`, `:fatal`. Probably most useful in conjunction with `:message` if you need to report an exceptional condition that's not an exception.
- `:logger` - a `String` which identifies the logger.
- `:message` - a map or `String` containing Message information. See below.
- `:platform` - a `String` which identifies the platform.
- `:release` - a `String` which identifies the release.
- `:request` - a map containing Request information. See below.
- `:server-name` - a `String` which identifies the server name.
- `:tags` - a map with `Keyword` or `String` keys (or anything for which `clojure.core/name` can be invoked) and values which can be coerced to `Strings` with `clojure.core/str`.
- `:throwable` - a `Throwable` object. Sentry's bread and butter.
- `:transaction` - a `String` which identifies the transaction.
- `:user` - a map containing User information. See below.

### Breadcrumbs

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/breadcrumbs/)

When an event has a `:breadcrumbs` key, each element of the value collection
should be a map. Each key is optional.

- `:type` - A `String`
- `:level` - a `String`
- `:message` - a `String`
- `:category` - a `String`
- `:data` - a map with `String` keys and `String` values
- `:timestamp` - a `java.util.Date`

### Message

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/message/)

When an event has a `:message` key, either a simple string can be
used, or if you require a parameterised message, the following data
should be contained within a map, thus:

- `:formatted` - A `String` containing the fully formatted message. If missing, Sentry will try to interpolate the `message`.
- `:message` - An optional `String` containing the raw message. If there are params, it will be interpolated.
- `:params` - An optional sequence of `String`'s containing parameters for interpolation, e.g., `["foo" "bar"]

### User

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/user/)

When an event has a `:user` key, the data following should be contained within
a map. You should provide at either the id or the ip-address.

- `:email` - A `String`
- `:id` - A `String`
- `:username` - A `String`
- `:ip-address` - A `String`
- `:other` - A map containing key/value pairs of `Strings`, i.e., `{"a" "b" "c" "d"}`

### Request

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/request/)

When an event has a `:request` key, the data should be contained within a map.
Each key is optional.

- `:url` - A `String`
- `:method` - A `String`
- `:query-string` - A `String`
- `:data` - An arbitrary value (e.g., a number, a string, a blob...)
- `:cookies` - A `String`
- `:headers` - A map containing key/value pairs of `Strings`, i.e., `{"a" "b" "c" "d"}`
- `:env` - A map containing key/value pairs of `Strings`, i.e., `{"a" "b" "c" "d"}`
- `:other` - A map containing key/value pairs of `Strings`, i.e., `{"a" "b" "c" "d"}`
